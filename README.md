### Project Idea

We plan to make a game that teaches people the basics of coding using a simple, self-designed
programming language. The idea is to create simple puzzles with increasing difficulty that ask the
player to solve programming-related problems, such as finding the minimum in an array, creating sums
etc.

## Getting Started
<!-- TODO -->

### How to Test

To run all the tests for this application, execute the maven command `mvn test`. This will
automatically run all the defined test using jUnit.

### How to Build

The project can be build using the maven command `mvn package`. This will create two runnable jars
in the `target` directory:
* `target/daro-1.0.0-game.jar` when executed will launch our game
* `target/daro-1.0.0-cli.jar` when executed will launch a small REPL (Read-Eval-Print-Loop) program
<!-- TODO -->

### How to Run

You can run the generated jar files using the Java VM by executing for example `java -jar
target/daro-1.0.0-game.jar` after having executed `mvn package`. If you just want to execute the
application withoud first packaging it, you can execute `mvn javafx:run` to execute the game and
`mvn exec:java` to execute the REPL program.
